# Cardiovascular Prediction Project

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description
This project aims to predict cardiovascular diseases using machine learning techniques. It analyzes health indicators such as age, gender, BMI, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors to build predictive models.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **`Cardiovascular-prediction.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Data**: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **Results**: Outputs and visualizations generated during the analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, and encoding).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Voting Classifier
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Gender**: Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female).
- **Height & Weight**: Physical measurements used to calculate BMI.
- **Blood Pressure (ap_hi & ap_lo)**: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings.
- **Cholesterol & Glucose Levels**: Indicators of metabolic health.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity.
- **Cardio**: Target variable indicating the presence of cardiovascular disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
